Guidelines on building UI with Qt Designer.

The Qt Designed functionality is also available in Qt Creator, but in this project we're only using
Qt Designer and not referencing Qt Creator.

## Edit `.ui` files
Edit files in Qt Designer:
```
inv ui.edit <file>
```
If using PyCharm, can also dbl click the `.ui` file from the _Project_ window.

## Compile/convert to `.py`
`.ui` files can be loaded at runtime using `QUiLoader`, but this has a performance hit as the `.ui`
file needs to be interpreted each time the app is executed.

Compiling/converting the `.ui` file into a python (`.py`) file is the preferred method for
production environments.

```
inv ui.py <file>
```

## Guidelines
Remember to give meaningful names to all objects in Qt Designer as these will be used in code.

!!! Warning

    If changing object names in Qt Designer, the code needs to be updated manually to that same
    name.

Particularly the top level widget in the form as that's going to be the name of the class being
imported in Python.

Sample names with suggested naming convention:

* UI file: `user_form.ui`
* Top level form name in UI file: `user_form`
* Python file: `ui_user_form.py`
* Class name in Python file: `Ui_UserForm`, autogenerated by `pyside6-uic`.  
  This follows the pattern `Ui_<camel case top level form name>`.
  
  !!! Note

      `pyside6-uic` does not support specifying the class name.

      Always follows the pattern above.

!!! Warning

    The `.py` files may be generated in a different encoding from that of other python files in
    the project that can cause errors like:

    They may be generated in UTF-16 while other python files are in UTF-8.

    The encoding can be checked and changed in the IDE.
